# Climate-Explorer

Description : The “Climate Explorer” project aims to streamline online weather prediction by providing users with a platform that allows them to find an accurate prediction of future weather at any given location. Leveraging Java for both frontend and backend development, along with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for web components, this project offers a seamless and intuitive interface for users to search for upcoming weather through a search bar.  The backend, built using Spring Boot, handles user requests and interacts with One Call API 3.0, allowing the application to aggregate previous weather patterns from the past 40 years based on user queries and displays them in a visually appealing manner. With features such as autocomplete in the search bar, dynamic sorting/filtering options, and interactive data visualization, Climate Explorer offers a comprehensive solution for users seeking a convenient and efficient way to stay updated with their local weather.
